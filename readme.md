UI-design shapes in Dia
=======================

By Nico Rikken

Project goal
------------
The goal of this project is to create a full-featured set of UI-elements aimed at Dia, in order to facilitate UI-mockups. This would suit usecases for which currently tools like Balsamiq would be used. Rather than relying on non-free tools or on dedicated apps, this would allow this set to build on the performance and features of Dia, from which a truely synergetic relationship can emerge.
